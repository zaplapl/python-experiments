Charlie Munger on expected returns over the medium-term

“It’s gotten very tough to have anything like the returns that were obtained in the past,” he said, pointing to higher interest rates and a crowded field of investors chasing bargains and looking for companies with inefficiencies.

Munger talks about low prospective returns in terms of higher rates and competition for bargains. But there is another way to make the same point, which is by pointing to high retrospective returns. Even after the beating stocks took in 2022, the S&P 500 has delivered 10-year compounded real returns of nearly 11 per cent. If you reach back to 2009, the annual real return is even higher. But one of the most reliable regularities in finance is the tendency of the real return of stocks to revert to 6-7 per cent over the long term. We have over-earned that average over the past decade or so, making it likely that we will under-earn in the years to come. To put the same point a third way: valuations are still high, and will fall.

unhedged says:

Faced with low prospective returns, there are two basic approaches an investor can take: decrease risk and wait, or increase risk and hope. 

-> prefer the former option

The latter approach, adding risk, is popular with the investors piling into private equity and credit [...] if we are in a world of permanently high asset prices — because of demographics and inequality, perhaps — and rates fall soon, this will prove to be the better approach.

there is worrying news from PE trusts:

Basically PE isn't marked to market & this:
- causes greater capital allocation, decreasing returns
- understates risk (because, erm no price signal)
- defeats the purpose of just taking a long-term position in public risk assets

On equity-risk premia:
Why would you do anything other than own short bonds, and just keep rolling them over? You can always add duration risk later, when the Fed hiking cycle is over. Yes, you might think that 4 ish per cent on long Treasuries is going to look mighty good when we fall into a recession, or you might just think 4 per cent is the cyclical top regardless. But those are bets. The 5 per cent one-year Treasury is basically just money in your pocket. 

Yes, 5.2 per cent is a flat-to-negative real return, depending on how you measure inflation. But you’re not going backwards. If you think inflation is near is a peak, you can extend your maturity, give up a little yield, and hope for a capital gain. If you think inflation could keep rising, buy the 6-month and roll it into something higher in September. And remember, as yields rise, the damage done to bond returns by further rate increases diminishes: the coupon is a natural insulator.

Stocks, meanwhile, are still expensive* by historical standards, at a moment of slowing sales, tightening margins, falling earnings and high volatility. Why not cut some risk, take the yield, and chill until autumn?

	Not like 2021, anyway. The S&P rests at 17.5 times forward earnings, a bit above the long-run average. In normal times, you might call such a valuation fair. But with higher-for-longer rates, a clear earnings contraction and potential recession hanging over equities, fair isn’t fair; it’s expensive.

	Lastly, the problems US equities face do not appear priced in. One simple way to see this is by looking at the equity risk premium — the extra compensation stock investors receive over the risk-free rate. You would think that between high recession risk, the threat of margin compression, improving alternatives in fixed income and much else, equities would be paying a whole lot more than bonds. But no, it’s at a decade low (chart)
